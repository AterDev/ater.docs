The droplet command tool helps developers generate commonly used code templates based on entity models (.cs files), including:
- DTO files, adding, updating, querying, listing and other DTO files
- Repository file, data warehousing layer code
- Controller file

For the frontend, you can generate the code (.ts) required for the request based on the json content of the swagger OpenApi, including:
- Request service, 'xxx.service.ts'
- Interface model, 'xxx.ts'

The [ater.web.templates](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ater.web.templates) project template is supported by default and is recommended to be used together.
